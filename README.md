# Movie-Reviews-Sentiment-Prediction-

Developed a comprehensive NLP-based Movie Review Sentiment Analysis project using advanced deep learning techniques. The model architecture features Bidirectional LSTM and GRU layers to effectively capture and analyze the contextual flow of text, crucial for understanding sentiment. Integrated dropout layers for regularization and Global Max Pooling for efficient feature extraction. Trained on the IMDB dataset, the model processes reviews up to 500 words, outputting binary sentiment (positive or negative) with a high degree of accuracy.

The project includes a user-friendly Streamlit-based web app for real-time sentiment analysis, where users can input movie reviews and receive sentiment predictions, integrated seamlessly with ngrok for public access. This showcases proficiency in natural language processing (NLP), deep learning, and interactive model deployment.
